# Claude Context File - Factory Test Station Project

## Quick Context for Next Claude Session

### What Was Accomplished
This session implemented comprehensive improvements to the factory test station:
- ✅ **Eliminated all popup dialogs** (web + TK interfaces)
- ✅ **Added automatic process cleanup** on startup  
- ✅ **Created persistent test results table** from configuration
- ✅ **Implemented portable Python environment** for DevOps
- ✅ **Matched TK interface to web interface** design

### Key Files to Understand
1. **`SESSION_RECORD.md`** - Complete session details and technical context
2. **`simple_gui_fixed.py`** - Main TK interface with persistent table (700+ line changes)
3. **`cleanup_utils.py`** - Process cleanup utilities (new file, 272 lines)
4. **`INTERFACE_COMPARISON.md`** - Feature parity documentation
5. **`config/station_limits_project_station.py`** - Table configuration source

### Current State
- **All changes committed and pushed** to `flying-pisces/factory_test_omi` (master branch)
- **No outstanding issues** - all requested features implemented
- **Fully tested** - all test scripts pass
- **Production ready** - comprehensive documentation included

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
cd /Users/cyin/project/factory_test_omi/factory_test_stations

# Run interfaces (all have automatic cleanup)
python project_station_run.py --tk      # TK with persistent table
python project_station_run.py --web     # Web interface (popup-free)  
python project_station_run.py --console # Console mode (default)

# Test functionality
python test_persistent_table.py         # Verify table config loading
python test_cleanup.py                  # Verify process cleanup
```

### User Requirements Status
- ✅ **Process cleanup on startup** - Implemented with comprehensive utilities
- ✅ **Persistent test table** - Loads from station_limits_project_station.py, retains results
- ✅ **No more popups** - Eliminated across all interfaces  
- ✅ **TK matches web layout** - Identical design and functionality
- ✅ **Portable environment** - DevOps-ready deployment solution

### For Next Session
If user returns to this project, they have:
1. **Complete session record** in `SESSION_RECORD.md`
2. **All requested features implemented** and tested
3. **Production-ready codebase** with documentation
4. **No pending issues** to resolve

The project is in excellent condition for continued development or handoff.
